# Loan-Acceptance-Prediction


# Challenge Overview

You are expected to go through the essential steps of the Data Science Lifecycle as presented in the lessons of Week 1. The steps you follow should include:
Do the exploratory Data Analysis
Preprocess the data before building your model
Train a Logistic Regression model that predicts if a loan would be accepted or not based on the given features, and then validate it.
Find the feature Importance in the resultant mode

# Objective

In this challenge, you will explore a Loan dataset, go through the steps of the Data Science Lifecycle, and finally be able to build a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a person’s loan will be accepted or rejected based on his/her features.
